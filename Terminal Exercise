The terminal is a program is just an interface to the shell. The shell is what actually handles commands.

The terminal program just gives it a way to interact with the content on the computer.

An absolute path is a path that starts from the root and gives the complete location for a file or folder. Example - /Users/Javier_DeJesus

A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not the root route and has to be relative to your location.

A flag adds additional functionality to an existing command such as,  -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands.

r will remove folders and go through folders, f is for force removal.
